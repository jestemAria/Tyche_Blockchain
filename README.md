# Tyche_Blockchain

This project is called Tyche Blockchain.
It is created as the result of software engineering project course for final bachelor project in university of Zanjan.
------
### About Tyche Blockchain:

Tyche Blockchain is focus on creating a blockchain based on _proof-of-work_ and deploy Tyche Coin as the cryptocurrency.
> It is based on JavaScript as the blockchain core and for blockchain backend. 
> The frontend will be based on React but it is not deployed and created yet.
> The new ideas of Tyche Blockchain and Tyche Coin will be documented as fast as they deploy in the project.
